Shatner vs Skywalker Races

A fun and challenging car racing project done in my second week of WDI.


Technologies Used:

Jquery, Bootstrap(minimal), Javascript, Html, Css.

Existing Features:

Name input, Winner alert

Planned Features:

Betting system, Single Player, Pickable Avatars, Sound integration.

Things i learned:  The usefulness of objects, I need to push to github more, how much stepping back and taking a break can really help.

Things i struggled with: Css and floating divs and trying to do too many things at once!

Overall i really enjoyed this project i'm dissapointed i wasn't able to add more features as it's pretty barebones right now
i got stuck on css and instead of scrapping my idea and trying something else i wasted too much time trying to find a solution. It wasn't until i stepped away that i was able to make progress.
