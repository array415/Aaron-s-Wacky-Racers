# Aaron-s-Wacky-Racers

This is currently a basic attempt at a racing game.

Currently i'm using basic objects, Jquery, callback functions and .animate() to achieve my goals.
I would like to style this game as 2 police officers chasing a criminal. In Hindsight my repo name was decided far to hastily.
